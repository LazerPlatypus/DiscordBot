Ability Scores and Modifiers|Each ability has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). To determine an ability modifier, subtract 10 from the ability score, then divide the total by 2, rounding down. Alternatively, the Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.|ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS~Score > Modifier~1 > -5~2/3 > -4~4/5 > -3~6/7 > -2~8/9 > -1~10/11 > 0~12/13 > +1~14/15 > +2~16/17 > +3~18/19 > +4~20/21 > +5~22/23 > +6~24/25 > +7~28/29 > +9~30 > +10|pg.57 - Player's basic rules
Advantage and Disadvantage|If you are given Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll, roll a second d20, on advantage, take the higher roll; on disadvantage, the lower roll.~If multiple situations affect a roll, and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, you still only roll one additional d20.~If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage, and only one grants advantage or vice versa.~When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can only roll one of the dice, you choose which one.||pg.57 - Player's basic rules
Proficiency Bonus|Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.~Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.~Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.~By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.~In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply."||pg.57-58 - Player's basic rules
Ability Checks|An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome in uncertain, the dice determine the results~For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand, and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.~To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. **If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success**--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM|TYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASSES~Task Difficulty > DC~Very easy > 5~Easy > 10~Medium > 15~Hard > 20~Very Hard > 25~Nearly Impossible > 30|pg.58 - Player's basic rules
Contests|Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. The situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.~Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other on from succeeding.~If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means the door remains shut.||pg.58 - Player's basic rules
Skills|"Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, ""Make a Wisdom (Perception) check"". At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.~For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check."|**Strength**~  Athletics~~**Dexterity~  Acrobatics~  Slight of Hand~  Stealth~~**Intelligence**~  Arcana~  History~  Investigation~  Nature~  Religion~~**Wisdom**~  Animal Handling~  Insight~  Medicine~  Perception~  Survival~~**Charisma**~  Deception~  Intimidation~  Performance~  Persuasion|pg.58 - Player's basic rules
Skills with Different Abilities|Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. SO if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check.~Similarly, when your dwarf fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. ||pg. 59 - Player's basic rules
Passive Checks|"A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly. Such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.~Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check~  *10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check*~If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive total as a **score**.~For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.~The rules on hiding in the ""Dexterity"" rules rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules"||pg.59 - Player's basic rules
Working Together|Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this required the Help action.~A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock required proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lasts that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.||pg.59 - Player's basic rules
